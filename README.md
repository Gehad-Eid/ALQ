Hello and welcome to ALQ عَلَق!
 
In this project, we will develop an augmented reality smartphone app that will teach young learners aged 10-15 years old about human anatomy and organs.

The Flutter framework in Dart (the language) is utilized in this project, together with the Visual Studio Code application.

To launch the application, the user must first sign up in order to have an account, then log in. When the user logs in, a welcome page appears, and the user can choose to start learning or go to their profile. If the user starts learning, then human body systems chapters will appear, and the user can choose a chapter and take lessons and see a 3D model, view AR, or take a quiz. If the user goes to their profile, they can see their information, score, and achievements. When the user has finished learning, they can log out.
