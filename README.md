Hello and welcome to ALQ عَلَق!

ALQ is an android mobile application project which is developed for young learners aged 10-15 years old to enhance their learning experience. It will provide an interactive and engaging platform for them to learn about the human body. The main feature of ALQ is augmented reality technology, which allows them to view 3D models of the human body and interact with them in real-time. ALQ also has many features they will enjoy while using it. We hope that after using ALQ, they will have a better understanding of human anatomy and find ALQ engaging and enjoyable.
